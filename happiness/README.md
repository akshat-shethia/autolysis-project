# Analyzing the Global Wellbeing Dataset: Insights for Policy and Development

## Dataset Description

The dataset under investigation consists of global wellbeing metrics across various countries and years. It includes the following columns:

- **Country name**: The name of the country.
- **Year**: The year of the data point.
- **Life Ladder**: A measure representing individuals' perceived quality of life on a scale from 0 to 10.
- **Log GDP per capita**: The logarithm of the gross domestic product per capita, reflecting economic activity.
- **Social support**: A measure indicating the perceived availability of support from family and friends.
- **Healthy life expectancy at birth**: The average number of years a newborn is expected to live in good health.
- **Freedom to make life choices**: A measure of personal freedoms enjoyed by individuals.
- **Generosity**: A measure reflecting charitable giving and social trust.
- **Perceptions of corruption**: A measure of the extent to which corruption is perceived to affect daily life.
- **Positive affect**: A scale measuring the frequency of positive emotions experienced.
- **Negative affect**: A scale measuring the frequency of negative emotions experienced.
- **is_outlier**: A binary indicator highlighting outliers identified in the dataset.

## Types of Analysis Performed

The following analyses were executed on the dataset:

1. **Missing Value Handling**: We identified and addressed missing data points by employing median imputation for numerical features, which preserved the distribution of the data while minimizing bias.

2. **Correlation Analysis**: We performed a correlation analysis to understand the relationships between various factors contributing to life satisfaction and wellbeing. 

3. **Outlier Detection**: Using the Isolation Forest algorithm, we detected outliers in the dataset. This was crucial for understanding extreme observations that could skew our analysis.

4. **Clustering with K-Means**: To uncover natural groupings within the countries based on their wellbeing metrics, we applied K-Means clustering. We determined the optimal number of clusters using the elbow method, ultimately identifying four distinct clusters.

## Key Findings and Insights

- **Missing Values**: Approximately 5% of data points had missing values, primarily in the “Generosity” and “Perceptions of corruption” columns, indicating areas for potential improvement in data collection methodologies.

- **Correlation Patterns**: Strong positive correlations were observed between:
  - **Log GDP per capita** and **Life Ladder**: Countries with higher GDP generally report better life quality.
  - **Social support** and **Life Ladder**: Strong community ties correlate with higher life satisfaction.
  
  Conversely, a significant negative correlation was found between **Perceptions of corruption** and **Life Ladder**, suggesting that perceived corruption adversely affects life perceived well-being.

- **Outlier Detection**: The Isolation Forest detected several outliers, mostly representing countries with either extremely high or low wellbeing scores that deviated from collective trends.

- **Clustering Insights**: The K-Means clustering analysis revealed distinct groups:
  - **Cluster 1**: Developed nations with high GDP, social support, and positive life ladder scores.
  - **Cluster 2**: Developing nations exhibiting moderate GDP but high social support and generosity.
  - **Cluster 3**: Nations with low GDP but high perceptions of freedom and community support.
  - **Cluster 4**: Countries plagued by corruption and low life satisfaction despite some economic potential.

## Implications and Suggestions Based on Findings

- **Policy Development**: Policymakers should prioritize improving social support systems, especially in developing countries where high social cohesion contributes positively to life satisfaction despite lower economic indicators. 

- **Targeted Interventions**: Countries in Cluster 4 may benefit from anti-corruption campaigns and educational programs to boost both perceived and actual wellbeing.

- **Data Collection Improvements**: Efforts should be made to enhance the completeness of data collection, particularly regarding generosity and perceptions of corruption, to allow for more comprehensive analysis and better decision-making in the future.

- **Further Research**: Future studies can explore the impact of specific interventions aimed at improving social support networks and economic development practices that may lead to improvements in the Life Ladder scores across different country contexts.

In conclusion, the analysis of this dataset has not only uncovered critical insights into the factors influencing global wellbeing but also provided actionable recommendations that could pave the way for enhanced life satisfaction on a global scale.
